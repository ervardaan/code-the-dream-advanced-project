# code-the-dream-advanced-project
advanced project submission for CODE THE DREAM for application in react and nodeJS courses for fall 2024

# Spotify API Project

## Description
This project fetches and displays data from the Spotify API. It shows featured playlists and allows navigation to view tracks.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ervardaan/code-the-dream-advanced-project.git
   cd spotify-api-project
2. now open the index.html file to get to the main page
3. go to playlists to see a list of playlists recommended by spotify
4. go to tracks page to see a list of every track of a special playlist you saw in the playlists page.

## SUPRPRISE
1. A random generator shows you the tracks of one of the playlists but you don't know which one. Thus if you refresh the tracks page, you will be able to see some new tracks pertaining to some new playlist.

## challenge for the advent user
Try to find relations between the playlists and the songs you find on the tracks page by Googling them and find songs of many different languages.

HOPE YOU HAVE FUN

## NEVER ENDING DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY
- Gaining a strong motivation after developing this project, I have also started developing my own spotify clone filled with natural language processing and machine learning algorithms including, but not limited to, recommender systems.
- This application is being developed with React, NodeJS,and WebAPI, the same publically available API for Spotify.
